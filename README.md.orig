## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Every commit containing this note is a modified version of one from my original private repo, with this README, the LICENSE files, and the license header comments retroactively added using [`git-filter-repo`][].

Something resembling proper documentation will be added later.

## How it works

See <https://github.com/Rhys-T/fenix-arbitrary-addons>.

- [Foxdriver][]  
  Copyright 2017-2021 Sauce Labs  
  Used under the [Apache License, version 2.0][Apache-2.0].  
  Foxdriver itself is being pulled in as a dependency, not vendored and patched. However, I am patching it at runtime, and have embedded small snippets into my code so that I know where to patch. I don't know if that counts as a "modified file" for section 4(b), but here's what I'm doing, just in case:
  - Patch the `Console.evaluateJSAsync` method to detect when it's passed an `async` function, and do the equivalent of using a top-level `await` in Firefox's console.
  - Patch the `Client` class to actually handle errors from the underlying socket, and send a 'Lost connection' error back to my code.
  - This one doesn't actually involve Foxdriver's code, but just for completeness: I'm wrapping the `net.createConnection` method so that I can connect Foxdriver to a Unix socket file, even though it only normally takes a host and TCP port.
- [Firefox][]  
  [extensionGeneric.svg][] used under the [Mozilla Public License, version 2.0][MPL-2.0].  
  It has been converted to a PNG using [Inkscape][][^contextfill], and then run through <code>[zopflipng][] -mm</code> to produce the version used here.  
  Steps to build the image:
  ```sh
  inkscape -w 128 -h 128 <(sed 's/context-fill-opacity/1/g; s/context-fill/black/g' extensionGeneric.svg) -o extensionGeneric.orig.png
  zopflipng -mm extensionGeneric.orig.png extensionGeneric.png
  ```
  Additionally, I figured out how to do this via a _lot_ of digging through the Firefox source code, and mozilla.d.ts contains hacky TypeScript descriptions of several of Firefox's internal APIs (for IntelliSense purposes, basically). I didn't knowingly copy any actual code from Firefox, however.


[^contextfill]: After patching it to use a real fill color instead of `context-fill`.
